# String-Equality-Checker
Takes in two strings and will determine whether or not String 1 can be turned into String 2 by deleting some of the characters.

For example: String1 : "abccd"
             String2 : "abd"

By removing the 'c' characters in String1 we will be given String2. Returns 1 (true).

Or, String1 : "ab"
    String2 : "ba"
    
 This will return 0 (false) as we cant remove any characters in String1 for it to become String2.

Done as part of a technical interview.
